The original authors have already provided a read-me describing these data, but here it is again, just incase it has been misplaced:

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

## I annotated the original code, and in the spirit of simplicity, I have just duplicated the code and the annotations here. The annotations identify the cleaning steps and are easy to associated with the relevant code.

## lod the tidyverse to do most/all of the data cleaning 

    library(tidyverse)

### Set the working directory in the next line

    setwd("THIS NEEDS TO BE UPDATED")

### context data---------------------

###create data frame for matching activity codes with activity names

      training.types.key<-read_table("UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt", 
                                     col_names = FALSE) %>%
        rename(activity.type.code=X1, 
               activity.type.name=X2)


### create dataframe containing the measurement/summary variable codes

      column.names<-read_table("UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt", 
                                  col_names = FALSE) %>%
  
  ## give the column names an easy-to-remember name
  
    rename(column.names=2) %>%
  
  ## keep only the column names 
  
    dplyr::select(column.names) %>%
  
  ## get rid of the ugly characters
  
        mutate(column.names=str_remove_all(column.names, '-'),
               column.names=str_remove_all(column.names, '\\('),

## load the activity code variable
  
    activity.type.code.train <- read_table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt", col_names = FALSE)
